emails into **Positive / Negative / Neutral** using ML.\n","\n","2. **Data**\n","   Used a large email dataset; observed **heavy class imbalance** (mostly positive emails).\n","\n","3. **Preprocessing**\n","   Minimal cleaning (lowercasing) to preserve sentiment-bearing words.\n","   Same preprocessing used for training and prediction.\n","\n","4. **Feature Engineering**\n","   Converted text to numbers using **TF-IDF (unigrams + bigrams)**.\n","   This captures both important words and short phrases.\n","\n","5. **Model Choice**\n","   Tested Logistic Regression and **SVM**.\n","   SVM performed better for text data (high-dimensional, sparse features).\n","\n","6. **Imbalance Handling**\n","   Applied **class weights** to penalize misclassification of negative emails.\n","   Focused on improving **negative recall**, not just accuracy.\n","\n","7. **Training Results**\n","   Training accuracy ≈ **97%**\n","   Testing accuracy ≈ **87%**\n","   Gap acceptable → slight overfitting but good generalization.\n","\n","8. **Prediction Pipeline**\n","   Built Excel → Model → Excel flow for real-world usability.\n","\n","9. **Key Learning**\n","   Accuracy alone is misleading in imbalanced datasets;\n","   **Recall and F1-score** matter more for critical classes (negative emails).\n","\n","10. **Outcome**\n","    End-to-end NLP + ML pipeline ready for practical use and demonstration.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3iOZvb490Lz1"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":96,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DNCUH6Ht0YvL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768901382657,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2016,"user":{"displayName":"Deshna

charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\\nX-From: \\\"Stephen P. Bowen\\\" <stevebowen@earthlink.net>\\nX-To: Jeffrey Dasovich <jdasovic@enron.com>, \\\"Dasovich, Jeff\\\" <Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com>\\nX-cc: \\nX-bcc: \\nX-Folder: \\\\Jeff_Dasovich_June2001\\\\Notes Folders\\\\All documents\\nX-Origin: DASOVICH-J\\nX-FileName: jdasovic.nsf\\n\\nPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION\\n\\nJeff,\\n\\nPer your request, I am writing a brief note to follow up on our\\ntelephone conversation today.  As we discussed, Enron plans to change\\nthe structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C\\ncorporation to an LLC.  As we discussed previously, this change in\\nstructure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities\\nCommission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of\\nthe Public Utilities Code.  You indicated that someone inside Enron was\\nconcerned that, during the course of the CPUC=01,s review of the request\\nfor transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax\\nreturns of ETI=01,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would\\nfind unattractive.  You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.\\n\\nAt a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over\\nentities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.  Depending on\\nthe facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this\\njurisdiction.  However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look\\ninto the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant\\ntelecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking\\nto acquire control of the carrier.  For nondominant telecommunications\\ncarriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch,\\nbecause such carriers have no market power.  You should also be aware\\nthat there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's\\nfinancial information from public disclosure.\\n\\nThus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review\\nthe books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in\\nconnection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.  ETI is a\\nnondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of\\nETI, because EBS will still be ETI=01,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC,\\nrather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management\\npersonnel of ETI.\\n\\nThe one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the\\nCommission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.  While this\\nlogically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably\\ntrigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need more information or want to discuss\\nfurther.\\n\\nSPB\\n\",\n          \"Message-ID: <6323061.1075847432764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 14:11:00 -0700 (PDT)\\nFrom:

As we discussed, Enron plans to change\\nthe structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C\\ncorporation to an LLC.  As we discussed previously, this change in\\nstructure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities\\nCommission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of\\nthe Public Utilities Code.  You indicated that someone inside Enron was\\nconcerned that, during the course of the CPUC=01,s review of the request\\nfor transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax\\nreturns of ETI=01,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would\\nfind unattractive.  You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.\\n\\nAt a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over\\nentities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.  Depending on\\nthe facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this\\njurisdiction.  However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look\\ninto the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant\\ntelecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking\\nto acquire control of the carrier.  For nondominant telecommunications\\ncarriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch,\\nbecause such carriers have no market power.  You should also be aware\\nthat there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's\\nfinancial information from public disclosure.\\n\\nThus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review\\nthe books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in\\nconnection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.  ETI is a\\nnondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of\\nETI, because EBS will still be ETI=01,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC,\\nrather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management\\npersonnel of ETI.\\n\\nThe one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the\\nCommission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.  While this\\nlogically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably\\ntrigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need more information or want to discuss\\nfurther.\\n\\nSPB\\n\",\n          \"Message-ID: <6323061.1075847432764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 14:11:00 -0700 (PDT)\\nFrom:

As we discussed previously, this change in\\nstructure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities\\nCommission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of\\nthe Public Utilities Code.  You indicated that someone inside Enron was\\nconcerned that, during the course of the CPUC=01,s review of the request\\nfor transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax\\nreturns of ETI=01,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would\\nfind unattractive.  You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.\\n\\nAt a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over\\nentities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.  Depending on\\nthe facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this\\njurisdiction.  However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look\\ninto the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant\\ntelecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking\\nto acquire control of the carrier.  For nondominant telecommunications\\ncarriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch,\\nbecause such carriers have no market power.  You should also be aware\\nthat there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's\\nfinancial information from public disclosure.\\n\\nThus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review\\nthe books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in\\nconnection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.  ETI is a\\nnondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of\\nETI, because EBS will still be ETI=01,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC,\\nrather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management\\npersonnel of ETI.\\n\\nThe one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the\\nCommission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.  While this\\nlogically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably\\ntrigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you need more information or want to discuss\\nfurther.\\n\\nSPB\\n\",\n          \"Message-ID: <6323061.1075847432764.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\\nDate: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 14:11:00 -0700 (PDT)\\nFrom:
